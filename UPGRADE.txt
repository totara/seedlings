UPGRADING A TOTARA SITE
=======================

These instructions detail the process for upgrading a Totara site to the latest
point release version. For upgrading a Moodle site see MOODLEUPGRADE.txt.

New requirements in Totara 2.6:

* PHP version 5.4 required for Windows. PHP version 5.3.3 still supported on Linux.
* PHP zlib and OPcache modules now recommended.
* MariaDB 5.3.5 now required (was 5.2 in Totara 2.5).

NOTE: To upgrade to Totara 2.6 you must be on Totara 2.2.22 or later. If your version
    is earlier than 2.2.22 the upgrade will not run. Versions of Totara prior to 2.2 must first
    upgrade to 2.2 via Totara 1.1.17+, then to at least 2.2.22, before upgrading to 2.6
